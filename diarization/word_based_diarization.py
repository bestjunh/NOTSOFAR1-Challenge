    These word based speech segments are used as the inputs to clustering.
    
    As a word's duration is usually too short for extracting reliable speaker embeddings, this function
    uses longer windows centered at the word to extract speaker embeddings.

    The affinity matrixes of different scales all have the same weights. 

    Note that in NeMo's recipe, larger scale affinity matrix contains fewer elements and resampling is needed
    to make the affinity matrixes of all scales having the same size. In this function, all affinity matrixes
